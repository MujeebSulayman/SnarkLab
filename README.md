# SnarkLab

**Don't let the shine out.**

SnarkLab is the easiest way to transfer assets privately while proving regulatory compliance.

## What is "SnarkLab"?

SnarkLab is a privacy wallet that lets you transfer assets confidentially on Ethereum while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

Whether you're:

- Protecting your financial privacy
- Proving transaction legitimacy to regulators
- Shielding your holdings from surveillance

→ SnarkLab gives you **encrypted balances**, tracks everything **in secure hardware**, and lets you **prove compliance** without exposing private data.

No privacy sacrifice. No regulatory risk. Just transfer assets the way they should be: confidential and compliant.

## How It Works

### Private Balances with TEE Security

We use Trusted Execution Environments to keep your funds confidential:

- **Deposit assets** — your balance is encrypted in secure hardware
- **Hardware-guaranteed isolation** — protected even from server operators
- **Efficient computation** — fast transactions without massive gas costs

### Sparse Merkle Trees for Scalable Privacy

Every private balance is tracked in an optimized Sparse Merkle Tree:

- **Constant-size proofs** — membership verification scales efficiently
- **On-chain root** — posted to Ethereum for verifiability
- **Perfect privacy** — no one can trace your balance or activity

### Zero-Knowledge Compliance Proofs

When regulators need verification, generate cryptographic proofs that show:

- Funds originated from legitimate sources
- Transaction amounts comply with legal limits
- No transfers to sanctioned addresses

All without revealing your identity, amounts, recipients, or balance.

### Confidential Transfers

Transfer assets with complete privacy:

- **Specify recipient and amount** — processed securely in TEE
- **Automatic verification** — balance checked, proof generated
- **Merkle tree update** — new commitments published on-chain
- **Ethereum settlement** — fully encrypted, verifiable transaction

To observers: just an on-chain state update. Your amounts, identity, and recipient stay completely confidential.
